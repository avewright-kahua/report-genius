Goal: 
Agent can query any entity and create any entity safely. 

Necessities:
- list of all entities in domain
- complete schema of every entity
    WITH required fields labelled accurately
- consistent logic 
    ex. Create contract item by defining it as 
    
    Items: {entityDef: kahua_Contract.ContractItem, CostEstimatedValue: ....}

    inside payload of Contract post request

- Upload media


LLM with tools, instead of hardcoding logic app by app i want it to be somewhat dynamic
which is why i started with ad hoc endpoints. It has two tools: one to query schema by 
entity and build a model and one to post using that schema.
